AFTER THE axis of evil comes the “exclusive club of rogue nations”. That at least is how John Bolton, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, described Venezuela’s place in the world when he spoke on the sidelines of a conference in Lima, the capital of Peru, on August 6th. The meeting, attended by representatives of 59 countries, was called by the Peruvian government to discuss what to do about the “day after” Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s president, falls from power. But it was the United States that stole the limelight. 
On August 5th Mr Trump signed an executive order to, in effect, quarantine Venezuela in economic terms. The order freezes Venezuelan government assets. It is the harshest measure to date, aimed at all assets instead of specific companies, such as the state oil producer, PDVSA, as in the past. But it also applies secondary measures to anyone doing business with Venezuela. It is these sanctions which most threaten Mr Maduro’s government. 
According to Mr Bolton, companies around the world need to decide whether they want to receive a “trickle of income” from Venezuela or trade with the United States. The measure would allow the United States to move against any company, country or individual trading with Venezuela. America has had similar third-party sanctions in place against Cuba since the early 1960s, but they have lacked international support. The measures in place against Venezuela now are more like those against Iran and North Korea. 
American authorities have despaired of Chinese and Russian companies operating in Venezuela. They have warned that debt incurred by what they say is an illegitimate Venezuelan government would not be recognised by Mr Maduro’s successors, if and when he falls. In his address to the conference, Mr Bolton said China and Russia should not “double down on a bad bet”. 
America has been careful to state that the new measure does not apply to humanitarian aid or telecoms, which would hurt ordinary Venezuelans. Mr Maduro’s government called the move “economic terrorism” and pledged to resist efforts to remove him from power in favour of Juan Guaidó, the speaker of the national assembly who is already considered by numerous countries to be Venezuela’s legitimate president. 
The Maduro regime and Mr Guaidó’s faction have been talking in Barbados, in negotiations brokered by Norway, not least about organising early elections. Mr Maduro began a second term in power in January. The United States and many Latin American governments oppose holding another election while he remains in power, claiming he could rig them—as he was accused of doing last year. 
Attendees of the Lima meeting, among whom were representatives of Mr Guaidó, recognise the massive task of reconstruction, starting with the state-owned oil company. Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, which made it one of the richest countries in South America. But production has crashed to less than 1m barrels a day, around two-thirds lower than in 2000. 
The United Nations in June estimated that more than 4m Venezuelans had fled the country. Some 850,000 have moved to Peru, the host of the meeting. The crisis, said Peru’s foreign minister, Néstor Popolizio, “has turned a country rich in resources into a disaster.”■
