###### Medicine, genetics and the law
# In genetic disease, who has the right to know—or not know—what?

IN THIS information-saturated age, what happens when the right to know comes up against the right not to know? The ease of genetic testing has brought this question to the fore. Genes, some of which contain disease-causing mutations, are shared within families, meaning the results of a test for a genetic condition inevitably affect more people than the one who consented to be tested. Two contrasting legal cases pitting these rights against each other—one in Britain, the other in Germany—stand to extend the idea of who, exactly, is a patient and to alter the way in which medicine is practised. 
Both cases involve Huntington’s disease (HD), a heritable neurodegenerative disorder. A single mutation gives rise to HD, meaning that every child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Symptoms, which include loss of co-ordination, mood changes and cognitive decline, tend to develop between the ages of 30 and 50, and the disease is ultimately fatal. Diagnosis is based on a simple blood test, and though there are treatments for the symptoms, there is as yet no cure. 
In the British case, scheduled for trial at the High Court in London in November, a woman known as ABC—to protect the identity of her daughter, who is a minor—is suing a London hospital, St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust, for not sharing her own father’s diagnosis of HD with her. ABC was pregnant at the time of his diagnosis, in 2009, and she argues that had she been aware of it, she would have terminated the pregnancy. As it was, she found out only after giving birth to her daughter. She later tested positive for the Huntington’s-causing mutation, meaning that her child has a 50% chance of having it too. 
Initially the case was struck out, on the grounds that letting it go to trial would risk undermining doctor-patient confidentiality. But in 2017 that decision was overturned. The appeal court concluded that situations could arise where a doctor had a duty of disclosure to a patient’s relatives, and that preventing the trial on the grounds that it posed a threat to the doctor-patient relationship was therefore not necessarily in the public interest. 
In Britain doctors have a duty under common law to protect a patient’s confidentiality, and are released from that duty only with the patient’s consent. However, professional organisations such as the General Medical Council recognise that breaching patient confidentiality may sometimes be necessary, in circumstances where not doing so would probably result in death or serious harm. Identifying such situations is left to doctors’ judgment. 
The German case is in some ways the mirror image of the British one. Unlike in Britain, in Germany the right not to know genetic information is protected in law. Nevertheless, in 2011 a doctor informed a woman living in Koblenz that her divorced husband—the doctor’s patient—had tested positive for HD. This meant that their two children were at risk of the disease. 
She sued the doctor, who had acted with his patient’s consent. Both children being minors at the time, they could not legally be tested for the disease, which, as the woman’s lawyers pointed out, is currently incurable. They argued that she was therefore helpless to act on the information, and as a result suffered a reactive depression that prevented her from working. A district court initially rejected the woman’s case, but that decision was later overturned. In 2014 the German Federal Court of Justice handed down a final judgment, once again rejecting her case. 
Both cases, then, test a legal grey area and their outcomes will be examined with interest by lawyers in other jurisdictions. If the right to know is legally recognised in Britain later this year, that may remove some uncertainties, but it will also create new ones. To what lengths should doctors go to track down and inform family members, for example? Will trust break down between patients and doctors if confidentiality is no longer watertight? 
It is the law’s job to balance these rights for the modern age. Some worry this is an impossible task, but it has to try. When the law falls behind technology, somebody often pays the price, and currently that somebody is doctors. As these two cases demonstrate, they find themselves in an impossible predicament—damned if they do, damned if they don’t.■
