On Division. By Goldie Goldbloom. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 288 pages; $26. 
NOVELS ABOUT life in ultra-religious sects usually focus on frustration. Written mostly by and for outsiders, their heroes tend to pine for escape. Even compassionate portraits, such as Chaim Potok’s “The Chosen” and Eve Harris’s “The Marrying of Chani Kaufman”, suggest that such cloistered societies are repellent as well as beguiling. Perhaps because novelists prize the feelings of individuals, they are instinctively sceptical about the appeal of closed, rules-bound groups. 
This makes “On Division”, a new novel by Goldie Goldbloom, unique. The story revolves around Surie Eckstein, a 57-year-old matriarch who suddenly doubts some of the restrictive mores of her Hasidic shtetl in Brooklyn; yet it conveys an abiding affection for this anachronistic world. At 54, Ms Goldbloom herself remains very much a part of that world, even if she, too, has departed from some of the norms and expectations of her ultra-Orthodox peers. 
“I’m not a rule follower. I’m not a team player. I’m the last person you would expect to be a Hasidic Jew,” the author confides from her home in Chicago, to which, after growing up in Australia and a spell in New York, she moved 27 years ago. But in the Hasids she sees a community she loves, with people who are faithful, honest, moral (“for the most part”) and committed to an intensely Jewish life. “At the same time, I go, ‘Goldie Goldbloom, you like to talk about big ideas that may not be found in traditional Jewish literature. Where do you fit into this world?’” 
The title of “On Division” alludes to both a major avenue in a big Hasidic neighbourhood in Williamsburg, and the more personal divisions that run through Surie—and the author. The catalyst for Surie’s existential drama is her discovery that—as a tired mother of ten and grandmother of 32—she is somehow pregnant again, and with twins. Her fierce ambivalence at the prospect of yet more children, and her anxiety about the gossip they will inevitably stoke (her neighbours hissing that she is a sex-crazed grandma, or speculating that she is covering for a granddaughter’s illegitimate pregnancy), lead her to hide her condition for as long as possible. Her success at keeping her bump under wraps from even her own “better-than-good husband” of 41 years leads her to wonder just how well he, or anyone, really knows her. 
Surie’s secret also dredges up pernicious thoughts about another story she never discusses: the untimely death of a beloved son who ran away because he was gay. She wonders what she could have done differently, and how she might have resisted the strictures of her insulated tribe. What, she asks herself, “was so terrible about loving a man instead of a woman? Did the Torah forbid loving?” 
Queer herself, Ms Goldbloom is well-placed to observe the ways Hasidic Jews can ostracise their own. She came out in her 40s, after divorcing her husband of 21 years, which led some acquaintances to shun her and her eight children. She does not go into detail, but her novel lists some of the tactics used to punish outliers: 
A stone would come through their front window. His beard could be forcibly cut off in the back of a moving van. Playdates would be cancelled. The meat from the butcher would always be too fatty…Marriage suggestions would dry up. 
Ms Goldbloom is quick to point out that, in real life, plenty of ultra-Orthodox Jews still eat in her home, despite her massive library of secular books (another no-no). But she also recounts the sage advice a rabbi gave her before she left Australia: “The religion itself, God Himself, is perfect and people aren’t.” Because she doesn’t feel ostracised by God, she says, she doesn’t mind what other people think. 
Considering these travails, it is surprising that she chose a Hasidic life, rather than being born to one. As a child, her family in Perth didn’t keep a kosher home. But what she learned about Judaism inspired her to become more religious. She taught herself Hebrew and Yiddish (“It was fun. I like codes”), then attended a seminary in Melbourne, followed by one in Brooklyn. Later, disappointed by the way Hasids treat queer people (many of whom resort to suicide), she created a blog for anonymous interviews with closeted ultra-Orthodox Jews. She fielded countless messages, many of them from Muslim, Amish or Mormon correspondents, who would tell her, “This is my story, too.” 
Ms Goldbloom hopes “On Division” reaches ultra-Orthodox readers, but she doesn’t see it as a book that is only about Jews. Like her debut, “The Paperbark Shoe”, this novel is really about the struggle to bridge differences. Children, she notes, will always defy expectations. Partners inevitably disappoint. “But there has to be a moment when you see the humanity of the other person,” she says. “There has to be a way to connect without fear.” ■
