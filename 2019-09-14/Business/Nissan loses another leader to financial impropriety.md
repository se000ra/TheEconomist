CARLOS GHOSN may have allowed himself some Schadenfreude this week. On September 9th Hiroto Saikawa fell on his sword after he, like Mr Ghosn, faced accusations of financial impropriety. Last November Mr Saikawa, chief executive since Mr Ghosn stepped down from that role in 2017, had been instrumental in bringing accusations of financial misconduct against the Frenchman, who was voted off the board in April. 
Mr Ghosn has been under house arrest since the spring, awaiting trial on multiple charges, including underreporting his compensation by about ¥9bn ($84m) from 2010 to 2018. Nissan’s board this week put the cost of the Ghosn affair at ¥35bn. The charge against Mr Saikawa—that he improperly pocketed ¥47m in performance-linked bonuses—is peanuts by comparison. He insists he was unaware he had done anything wrong, echoing Mr Ghosn’s protestations that he never did anything that had not been approved by Nissan. He blames the bonus scheme on his ill-fated predecessor. It nevertheless adds to an image of mismanagement that has almost halved Nissan’s share price in the past year. 
In the early 2000s Mr Ghosn helped return loss-making Nissan to profitability. But recently the firm has struggled in the hyper-competitive mass market. In July it posted a 98.5% fall in first-quarter profits and said it could cut 12,500 jobs. Its partnership with Renault, a French carmaker that owns 43% of its stock, is creaky. An uneasy alliance between the two and Mitsubishi of Japan was held together by the Napoleonic Mr Ghosn’s charisma. 
Many shareholders wanted Mr Saikawa out for failing to heal the rift. Industry-watchers think a full Franco-Japanese merger makes sense in an industry dominated by giants like Toyota or Volkswagen, which churn out 10m cars a year and whose huge economies of scale leave more to invest in pricey electric and driverless technology. But Nissan, which makes more cars than Renault and resents the French claim on its profits, has resisted such a tie-up. With Mr Saikawa’s exit, due on September 16th, it is all somebody else’s problem. Nissan says that around ten candidates are in the running to inherit the mess. 
Correction (12th September): A previous version of this article named Mr Saikawa as Nissan’s chairman. He never held that post. Sorry
