Everybody’s Doin’ It: Sex, Music, and Dance in New York, 1840-1917. By Dale Cockrell. W.W. Norton; 288 pages; $27.95 and £19.99. 
IN THE SPRING of 1899 a committee was convened in New York to investigate the city’s police force—and the “protection” it might be offering to Gotham’s saloons and brothels. Politicians and do-gooders were particularly interested in a new kind of music known as “rag-time”, which William Devrey, the police chief, called “a filthy abomination”. 
He was not alone in that opinion. As Dale Cockrell writes in his terrifically entertaining book, this was only a part of the “public avalanche of criticism that questioned ragtime’s character and the moral bearings of people who enjoyed it.” Arthur Weld, a professor of music, pronounced the genre “evil” and “vulgar”. It was nothing short of a “national calamity”. 
Mr Cockrell is professor of musicology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. In “Everybody’s Doin’ It” he makes a bracing case that New York was the hothouse in which American popular-music culture took root. He considers the intersection of musicianship and morality from the early days of “blackface minstrelsy”—in which white performers insultingly darkened their faces—through to the birth of ragtime and jazz. The lives he writes about were mostly lived below “the horizon of record”; he mines newspapers and police reports, as well as the testimonies of middle-class witnesses that drip with condescension for those “beneath their place”. 
The result is an energetic, colourful tour of the city’s dens of iniquity. “Dives”, as such spots are known to this day, were usually in cellars, so people “dived” into them. The bars, brothels and concert halls that Mr Cockrell describes were places of sexual liberation, where men and women danced the hoochie koochie, the bunny hug, the wiggle and the shiver; they spieled, they hopped, they dipped. They inculcated racial freedom, too. Enslaved New Yorkers were freed by 1827; by 1873 racial discrimination was outlawed in the city. Yet one consequence of the increased regulation of musical entertainment thereafter was segregation, as moralisers frowned on racial mixing. Thus “the spirit of Jim Crow started casting its long, dark shadow over New York’s social, political, and cultural life.” 
The book’s focus may seem narrow, but the vividness with which Mr Cockrell evokes a vanished world is compelling. The only thing missing is a soundtrack; readers will long to hear “Roll Me Around Like a Hoop My Dear”, “Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland” or the “Boogie Man Rag”. Even in silence, however, by the last page the author has proved his point: that the musical, terpsichorean and sensual turmoil of the great city made for “an explosive compound of sounds and rhythms that would prove quite impossible to extinguish.” ■
