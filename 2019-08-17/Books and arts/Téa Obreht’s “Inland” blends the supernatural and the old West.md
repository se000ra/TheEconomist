Inland. By Téa Obreht. Random House; 384 pages; $27. Weidenfeld & Nicolson; £14.99. 
TÉA OBREHT, a prizewinning Serbian-American author, has a penchant for ghosts and exotic beasts. Her debut novel, “The Tiger’s Wife”, was an affecting meditation on war and survival in an unnamed Balkan country that circled around the titular tiger and a spectre known as “the deathless man”. Her second novel takes this otherworldly sensibility into the Arizona Territory of the late 19th century. “Inland” is half magical, half historical fiction: the braided tale of two unusual characters scratching a life from a harsh landscape, whose destinies will surely collide. 
The book belongs mainly to Nora, mother of three boys and a daughter who died of heatstroke in infancy but lives on as a voice in Nora’s ear. Her husband and grown sons have now vanished; Nora is parched and at her wits’ end. Her town is threatened by drought and economic ruin. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the desert territories, an orphan and outlaw named Lurie finds himself joined to an exotic—and historically accurate—parade: a procession of camels on their way to become pack animals for the cavalry. 
This tall tale, like Ms Obreht’s first, conjures a mythical, supernatural world. It bears a resemblance to “Days Without End”, a magnificent recent Western by Sebastian Barry, an Irish author. Both novels are lush and poetic; both nod to the West’s bloody history, yet hover vaguely, and gorgeously, above it. “Inland” is most compelling in its study of the pioneer wife whose frustrations and fears lead to tragedy. Yet, disappointingly, it succumbs to a sort of dreamy inevitability about the settlement of the West that will add little to most readers’ grasp of the period. Natives are seen only from the settlers’ point of view; the whole is awash in the slanted light of fable. 
Ms Obreht has a gift for vivid language and deft stories-within-stories. Descriptions of the camels, especially, are delightful: “Their eyelids are thatched with the finest lashes God ever loomed.” She gives words fresh purposes, to great effect; verbs sizzle. In “Inland”, Lurie fills the philosopher’s role; he can see the dead, and mourns the fact that they cannot see one another and thus are doomed to roam eternity alone. “Who would speak of these things when we were gone?” he asks in a wistful key, ticking off things that seem irrevocably past: the native people, the first sighting of a steamship, the “old emptiness” of the West. The story quickens to its haunting end—if not to any new frontier.■
