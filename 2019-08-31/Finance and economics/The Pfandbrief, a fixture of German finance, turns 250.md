IN 1769 THE noble landowners of Silesia—then in Prussia, now in Poland—were short of cash. War and plummeting farm output had left their mark. On August 29th the king stepped in. Frederick the Great issued an order establishing a Landschaft, or landowners’ co-operative. That allowed the hard-up nobles to issue, in 1770, the first Pfandbrief: a tradable bond, secured on individual properties and the assets of the whole Landschaft. The first investors, write Fritz Engelhard of Barclays, a bank, and Friederike Sattler of Goethe University in Frankfurt in a book* marking the Pfandbrief’s 250th birthday, included merchants, royal houses and the churches. 
The Pfandbrief, or covered bond, became a mainstay of German finance, in particular the mortgage market. Over time the landowners’ individual liability to bondholders ended. They were liable to their Landschaften, which in turn were liable to investors. In the 19th century Pfandbriefe came to be issued by specialised mortgage banks, which backed the bonds with housing loans. In the late 1800s building, banks and bonds boomed. Banks inevitably lent too freely and some investors lost money. A legal overhaul of Pfandbriefe ensued in 1899. 
These days 82 German banks issue Pfandbriefe, up from 40-odd in 2005, when the market was loosened. Last year €50.4bn-worth ($59.5bn) of bonds were issued, according to the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks (VDP), up a bit from 2017. Of these, €43.2bn were backed by mortgages, a 17% jump. Public-sector bonds made up the rest, but these have dwindled in recent years. In the first half of 2019, €34.9bn of Pfandbriefe were sold. Over €365bn-worth are outstanding, €237bn mortgage-backed. That is around 12% of the entire German bond market (government bonds make up half). 
Several other countries, chiefly in Europe but also in Asia, have their own covered bonds. (Denmark’s market is the world’s biggest, at around €400bn.) Unlike most American mortgages, the underlying loans stay on issuing banks’ balance-sheets. That, plus strict collateralisation rules and safeguards for bondholders if banks go bust, makes covered bonds safer bets than American mortgage-backed securities, according to the bonds’ boosters. A European Union directive this year set out a common framework, as part of the EU’s efforts to create a single capital market. That may increase the attractions of Frederick’s ancient instrument.■
