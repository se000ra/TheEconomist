GIUSEPPE CONTE is poised to boldly go where no Italian technocrat has gone before. Independent prime ministers in Italy either bow out at the end of their governments or get shoved aside by the voters if they try to hang on. But on August 29th President Sergio Mattarella asked Mr Conte to form a second coalition, this time teaming the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). 
Mr Conte has spent 14 months heading an all-populist government that yoked the Five Stars to the hard-right Northern League. The League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, ill-advisedly pulled the rug this month, thinking it was under his allies’ feet, when in fact it was under his own. The M5S has around a third of the seats in parliament, and can command a majority with the help of the PD and independent lawmakers. 
In his resignation speech on August 20th, the popular Mr Conte excoriated the League leader to his face, calling him disloyal and irresponsible. The former university law teacher’s performance endeared him to the Five Stars, to the point that they made his continuance in office a condition for a deal with the PD. 
A second Conte government will please officials in Brussels. They feared that Mr Salvini’s plans for drastic tax cuts, in a country already saddled with a debt equivalent to 134% of GDP, could panic the markets and jeopardise the euro. It will also delight Donald Trump, who tweeted his support for his “highly respected” buddy, “Giuseppi” (sic). 
But there are snags. The M5S intends to seek its members’ approval in an online ballot. If they vote against the alliance, it will probably force a general election. Italy can ill afford that. It could take until November to hold the vote, and parliament has to approve a budget by year’s end. That will be tricky: €23bn ($25bn) in deficit cuts are needed to meet EU limits. Otherwise, value-added-tax rates will have to be raised. 
Moreover, in over a week of negotiation, the Five Stars and PD seemed to have agreed on little more than the prime minister’s name. The M5S’s founder, Beppe Grillo, suggested the cabinet might include other technocrats. 
Perhaps most important, the two parties have sharply different cultures. Though most Five Star activists lean left, they disdain the liberal elite and see the PD as its embodiment. That was not a problem with the League, though it backed some policies they disliked. The fate of Italy’s new government may show which is the stronger bond—ideological affinity or a populist temperament.■
