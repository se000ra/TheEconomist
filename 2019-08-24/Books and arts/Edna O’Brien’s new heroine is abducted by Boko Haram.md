EDNA O’BRIEN launched her illustrious career in 1960 with “The Country Girls”, an incendiary, trailblazing novel that charted the fortunes and sexual awakening of two young women in the Ireland of the 1950s. Two equally controversial follow-ups, “The Lonely Girl” (1962) and “Girls in their Married Bliss” (1964), again depicted female desires and aspirations with compassionate candour. Almost 60 years after her debut, Ms O’Brien’s new book, “Girl”, evinces an enduring interest in girlhood. Despite the stark title’s suggestion of anonymity, the protagonist has a name. But she loses everything else when she is abducted and brutalised by Boko Haram. 
“I was a girl once, but not any more.” So begins Maryam’s harrowing tale. Seized from her school, she is brought to a terrorist camp and inducted into “the Sect”. She and her friends are made to wear hijabs and worship a different God. She witnesses extreme violence and experiences it, during ordeals designed to send men away “sated and battle-maddened”. One militant chooses her to be his trophy wife and she is no longer “plundered” nightly. But she loses her status when her husband falls from grace and she gives birth—not to a future fighter but to a daughter. 
Maryam’s luck turns after an aerial assault on the camp. She flees with her baby but faces further hardship and danger in the forests of north-eastern Nigeria, then hostility and prejudice in the country’s capital. Strangers view her with fear and suspicion; some relatives treat this “bush wife” and her “tainted” child with disdain. She seeks salvation elsewhere. 
In “Terrorist” (2006), his novel about a radicalised teenager, John Updike, another venerable writer, fell short of his high standards. Ms O’Brien, now 88, took a risk in giving voice to a Nigerian girl who suffers horrific cruelty, especially in an age when “cultural appropriation” is often frowned upon. But like her previous novel “The Little Red Chairs” (2015), which dealt with Balkan war crimes, “Girl” is a product of rigorous research and great artistry. Maryam and her plight are tragically authentic. 
At times, darkness almost overwhelms the reader. Yet it is hard to turn away, just as it is impossible not to back a heroine who, though bowed, refuses to be broken. “Girl” is Ms O’Brien’s most ambitious novel—and among her most powerful. ■
